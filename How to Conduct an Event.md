# ⭐ How to Conduct an Event

On 25th November, we conducted a discussion and talk event with around 10 industry AI practitioners. It was on Understanding LLM Economics. Out of the Setu office. Here are some learnings based on this first event.

&#x20;Learnings Our friends at LXD Lab have created tools we should keep in mind to design a good learning experience event. [Read them here](https://www.lxdlab.org/motivation-matters/tools).

## Rules

1. Be more explicit on your background. Define the question. Make a cohort.
2. Engaging events are important. Don't take Always have someone who seeds questions going forward
3. Ensure you have twice the registrations as you need for the invitation. i.e. Assume on averge a 50% drop-off for people in attending the event after registering.
4. Start with the WHO. Answer the following questions for your learner:
   1. Who are you designing for? Why are they the right audience for you?
   2. What do you know about your learners' core needs and wants?
   3. How can you assess the current skill levels of a learner?
5. Then get to the WHAT. Answer the following questions for your program:
   1. What are the specific learning objectives and outcomes we want to achieve?
   2. What curriculum, content, and resources will best support the learning objectives?
   3. What should be the scope, sequence, and complexity of the content that is covered?
   4. How might the learners use this curriculum in their current context?
6. And finally, come to the HOW. Answer the following questions about your methodology:
   1. How might we personalise the experience for each learner?
   2. How might we promote active learning techniques?
   3. How might we integrate usage of interactive elements and rich media effectively?
   4. How might we create tight feedback loops for visibility and progress?
