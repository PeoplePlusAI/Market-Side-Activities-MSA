# Notes on Community Building

## Book Summary: Get Together by Bailey Richardson, Kai Elmer Sotto, and Kevin Huynh



### Building a Community

1. **Building with, not for them:** Avoid the trap of creating communities for others without understanding their needs or being a user yourself​​.
2. **Shared purpose:** Communities should be united by a common, non-self-serving vision​​.
3. **Valuing disagreements:** Disagreements can reveal important issues and shape social norms and alignments​​.
4. **Share origin stories:** Successful communities often have compelling origin stories, fostering a shared vision and purpose​​.
5. **Grow beyond the founder:** Growth requires recruitment efforts extending beyond the founder, empowering others to contribute​​.
6. **Show, don't tell:** Use visuals and member stories to convey your community's essence​​.
7. **Authenticity in events:** Community events should feel genuine, not overly curated or staged​​.
8. **Member identification:** Developing a name for members helps in fostering group identification​​.
9. **Developing leaders:** Focus on nurturing leaders within the community rather than managing behavior​​.
